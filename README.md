# WEB103 Prework - *CreatorVerse*

Submitted by: **Dawit Alemu**

Time spent: **8** hours

About this web app: **Your mission 🧑‍🚀 is to build a frontend that supports CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on your favorite content creators. Your content creators can be Twitch streamers, YouTube channels, Instagram personalities, TikTok accounts, or similar. Heck, they can even be Mastodon microbloggers.

The purpose of your app is to share at least five creators you think are worth following and give yourself the ability to create, update, and delete creators. Each Creator should have:

a name
a url (the link to their channel or page)
a description
(optional) an imageURL that links to a picture of the creator or some of their content
You must use React to create your app, and you may optionally use PicoCSS to style HTML elements.

Let's get started! 🚀**
